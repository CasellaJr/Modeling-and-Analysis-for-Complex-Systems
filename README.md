# Modeling-and-Analysis-for-Complex-Systems
Report and MATLAB code for the final exam of the course in Modeling and Analysis for Complex Systems, taught by Prof. G. Nunnari.

## Description
The aim of this paper is to illustrate the principal theory concepts learned during the Academic Course in Modeling and Analysis for Complex Systems, taught by Prof. Giuseppe Nunnari, at University of Catania, and to show how to apply these concepts to practical cases. The case study of this report is a time series taken by a set of datasets provided for the ACM Nanocom 2021 Data Competition, related to experimental molecular communication systems. The report is organized as follows. In Chapter 1 the main concepts about stochastic processes will be summarized. In Chapter 2, the main time series concepts will be summarized. In Chapter 3, the main features of the models learned in the Course will be summarized (MA, AR, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, ARMAX, NARMAX). In Chapter 4 The model validation problem will be addressed. In Chapter 5, The available software tools will be described (Ident, Econometric...), nntool,etc). In Chapter 5, each model will be applied to the proposed case study. In Chapter 7, conclusions will be drawn. Finally, in appendix, the implemented software code will be reported.

## Dataset
